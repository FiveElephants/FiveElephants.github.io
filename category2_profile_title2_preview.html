  <h1>Guiding system for visually impaired in public transportation - collaborative project IAD, TU Darmstadt and IDC, IIT Bombay</h1> Students Exchange program between Industrial Design Centre (IDC), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India and IAD, Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany. This program is an attempt to promote cross cultural problem solving among participating
  departments of institutes of India and Germany. This project is an attempt to help the visually impaired people access public transportation with less difficulty and navigate to places of their requirement more efficiently.

From primary research and literature review done in Darmstadt and Mumbai, the main areas that need help were identified as
<br /><br />
<b>Locating origin bus stop</b><br />
<b>Locating the right bus</b><br />
<b>Access the bus</b><br />

<b>Evaluation</b>
<br /><br />
The first prototype was made by building a simple glove which gave feedback in the form of vibration on inner forearm above wrist. The wearable is in the form of a glove for ease of wearing during testing to keep the vibrator fastenend in place. The feedback was generated by a wired controlled that we built using gates to give 5 types of vibration combinations.
