  <h1>Samay Lekha</h1> A tool for collecting Time Use Data.
  <br /><br /> Time use studies rely on either participants keeping track of their activities or data collectors observing and interviewing participants. This is effort intensive relative to the quality of data thus collected. In this project, I attempt
  to create a Time Use Data collection tool that is context aware, effortless for the respondent and saves data in a research-convenient format. Samay Lekha is a smartphone application which attempts to enable entering data as easy as any daily routine
  for the respondent.

  <br /><br />

  <img src="samay_lekha/04.png" /><br /><br /> Exclamation means the activity is not completed on the timeline. Still some editing is required which means not all fields are completed but some marker is added. On tapping the Exclamation, the user gets
  to edit the activity to update it.

  <br /><br />
  <img src="samay_lekha/06.png" /><br /><br /> The data gets saved in the database and the details are in a simple format based on the tags. This can be easily viewed and sent to the researcher. The option to extract this is available in the burger button
  from the app.

  <img src="samay_lekha/10.png" /><br /><br /> Feature Testing<br /><br /> In order to make this effort intensive process of data entry seamless with the daily routine of respondents, the design decision of Samay Lekha has a lot of features. There are
  multiple input methods for recording time, which was based on Respondent interviews.
  <br /><br />
  <img src="samay_lekha/11.png" /><br /><br /> Whatsapp groups were made with each respondent and they could send voice recording, picture of their activity or type the details as they wished Evaluation Using the prototype an evaluation was done with
  think aloud test and a form was filled with interviews later. Two tasks of recording time with camera and microphone were given in think aloud test. Later they were asked to use the application for 24 hours
